# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Developer site
>   npm create vite@latest ./ -- --template react
<br>

>   npm install -D tailwindcss
<br>

>   npx tailwindcss init
<br>

>   npm install --legacy-peer-deps @react-three/fiber @react-three/drei maath react-tilt react-vertical-timeline-component @emailjs/browser framer-motion react-router-dom
- --legacy-peer-deps: some of the react packages use older version of react, specially 'react-tilt' so we have to install this to be able to use older versions too.
- @react-three/fiber: this is a react based 3js library that's going toallow us to create 3js code in a react fashion
- maath: for math utility function. When working with 3js there's going to be a lot of geometry 
- react-tilt: it's going to provide cool animations when howering over our cards
- react-vertical-timeline-component: for the experience similar to the one on linkedin 
- react-router-dom: for routing
